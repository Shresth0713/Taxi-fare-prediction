# Taxi-fare-prediction
The project focuses on building a reliable predictive model that estimates the fare of a taxi ride based on factors such as distance, time of day, number of passengers, and other relevant features. The linear regression algorithm is employed to establish a linear relationship between the input variables and the fare, enabling accurate predictions.
